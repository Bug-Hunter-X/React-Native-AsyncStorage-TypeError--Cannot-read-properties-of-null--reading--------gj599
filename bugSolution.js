The solution involves adding checks to handle the case where the data retrieved from AsyncStorage is null. This is done by checking if the data is null before accessing its properties.  Here's how you might implement the fix:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@user_data');
    let userData = null;
    if (jsonValue !== null) {
      userData = JSON.parse(jsonValue);
    } 
    //Now you can safely access userData
    console.log('user data:', userData?.name); //using optional chaining 
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Read Error:', e);
  }
};
```
This improved code first checks if `jsonValue` is null.  If it's not null, it proceeds to parse the JSON; otherwise, `userData` remains null, and subsequent attempts to access its properties won't throw an error thanks to optional chaining.  Also, a `try...catch` block gracefully handles potential errors during JSON parsing.
