This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native, specifically when trying to access data that doesn't exist.  It's often masked by the lack of explicit error handling, making it harder to debug.  The AsyncStorage.getItem() method resolves to null if the key isn't found, but this can cause downstream issues if not handled correctly.  For example, trying to access a property of a null object will result in a TypeError.
